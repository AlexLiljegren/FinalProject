# Title: Dragon Art
# Repository Link
https://github.com/AlexLiljegren/FinalProject-Proposal
# Description
In this project I want to utilize pillow and its drawing functions to create a piece of art that showcases a cool dragon! 
This is relevant to digital arts and media because it is, of course, a program that creates a piece of digital art.
# Features
This program's features will mainly include drawing lines with pillow and adding color with pillow
# Challenges
I will likely need to learn how to fill certain small parts of the screen in order to color in each piece of the dragon and keep it distinct from the background. 
I've also never drawn anything complicated in a coded program like this before, so this will likely take some trial and error to get comfortable and efficient with this process.
# Outcomes
## Ideal Outcome
Ideally I'm hoping for a fully sketched and colored dragon, with a decently nice background behind it as well
## Minimal Viable Outcome
A fully sketched dragon with no coloring, and at least a single colored background for contrast.
# Milestones
Since I have about five weeks to finish this project as of November 4th, I'm guessing that my milestones will look somethinglike this:
## Week 1
Get familiar with using pillow again, and understand how to draw many lines in conjunction to create a sketch.
## Week 2
Be fully acquainted with pillow, and start working on the actual dragon sketch.
## Week 3
Finish dragon sketch, and finish the background as well.
## Week 4
Fill everything in with color.
## Week 5
Extra week in case I need more time.
